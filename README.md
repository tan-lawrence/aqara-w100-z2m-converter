# Aqara W100 External Converter for Zigbee2MQTT + Home Assistant Blueprint

**Edit:** Those changed have been merged in zigbee-herdsman-converters by ['PR #10787'](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters/pull/10787)
They will available for next z2m december 2025 release. 

**This project provides:**

- A dedicated Zigbee2MQTT external converter for the Aqara W100 Climate Sensor.
- A Home Assistant blueprint for seamless, bidirectional sync between the W100's virtual thermostat and any climate entity.

It turns the W100 into a reliable, flexible front-end for your heating/cooling system while preserving its native behavior and making it play nicely with your existing Home Assistant setup.

**Important:** The external converter allows decimal in temperature setpoint. However the W100 firmware only reports integer values. 
Until Aqara fix this (will they ?), there's no way to set decimal set points from the w100 panel.

## Key Features

### 1. Robust initialization after pairing

The included converter ensures a clean, deterministic state as soon as the W100 is paired:

- Correct initialization of:
  - `Thermostat_Mode` (starts as `OFF` to match device behavior)
  - `system_mode`
  - `occupied_heating_setpoint`
  - `fan_mode`
  - internal defaults and metadata
- Prevents `null`/inconsistent values in Zigbee2MQTT.
- Keeps the device out of unintended thermostat mode on first join (and explicitly enforces `OFF` once during configuration).

All of this is implemented directly in [`w100.js`](w100.js).

---

### 2. Virtual climate entity exposure

The converter exposes a full-featured virtual climate entity in Zigbee2MQTT for the W100:

- `system_mode`: `off`, `heat`, `cool`, `auto`
- `fan_mode`: `auto`, `low`, `medium`, `high`
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: configurable range (see below), 1°C step
- `local_temperature`: kept in sync, based on the W100's internal temperature reports
- `Thermostat_Mode`:
  - `ON`: W100 behaves as a thermostat front-end (encrypted button payloads, middle line enabled).
  - `OFF`: W100 behaves as a remote/sensor (actions exposed, thermostat behavior disabled).

This creates a stable "virtual thermostat" entity that can be mapped to any actual heating/cooling device in Home Assistant.

---

### 3. System and fan mode control

The converter handles and normalizes all key HVAC parameters:

- System mode:
  - `off`: power off state (with last active mode preserved)
  - `heat`
  - `cool`
  - `auto`
- Fan mode:
  - `auto`
  - `low`
  - `medium`
  - `high`

Changes are converted into the Aqara-specific PMTSD protocol frames and sent to the W100 with:

- Debounced / rate-limited sending
- Stateful handling of last active mode when toggling `off`/`on`
- Consistent state updates exposed back to Zigbee2MQTT

---

### 4. Temperature setpoint handling and per-device range

- Exposes `occupied_heating_setpoint` as the target temperature.
- Supports a **per-device configurable target range** via Zigbee2MQTT device settings:
  - Navigate to your W100 device → **Settings** → **Device specific**
  - Configure:
    - **Min Target Temp**: Minimum allowed temperature (default: 5°C, range: -20°C to 60°C, step: 0.5°C)
    - **Max Target Temp**: Maximum allowed temperature (default: 30°C, range: -20°C to 60°C, step: 0.5°C)
  - These values **persist across restarts** and are specific to each W100 device
- **Default range** (if not configured): 5°C to 30°C
- **Enforcement**:
  - The climate entity's temperature range in MQTT discovery uses your configured values
  - Setting temperature outside the configured range is rejected with a clear error message
  - Validation occurs in [`PMTSD_to_W100.convertSet()`](w100.js:311) using `meta.options`
- **Dynamic behavior**:
  - The [`exposes` function](w100.js:904) reads configured values from device-specific options
  - The climate entity's [`withSetpoint()`](w100.js:920) uses these configured values for min/max
  - Changes to min/max settings require a Z2M restart to update the MQTT discovery configuration
- Temperature values are rounded to integer °C for the device, while allowing half-degree configuration precision
- Always kept in sync with the underlying PMTSD state to avoid desync between UI and device

### 5. Battery voltage and percentage

The W100 does not use standard `batteryVoltage` reporting. The converter:

- Parses Aqara's proprietary TLV data (manuSpecificLumi, attribute `0x247`).
- Extracts:
  - `battery_voltage` (V)
  - `battery` (%), derived from voltage.
- Also configures standard `genPowerCfg.batteryPercentageRemaining` reporting when available.


---

### 6. Additional exposes and options

The converter also exposes:

- Internal temperature: `temperature` / `local_temperature`.
- `PMTSD_from_W100_Data`: last raw PMTSD frame decoded (for debugging/advanced usage).
- OTA support via `lumiZigbeeOTA`.
- External sensor mapping (temperature/humidity).
- Multiple configuration options via `modernExtend`:
  - Auto hide middle line when in thermostat mode.
  - High/low temperature and humidity alerts.
  - Sampling and reporting modes and periods.
  - Identify and other quality-of-life settings.

See [`w100.js`](w100.js) for the full list of exposed entities and options.

## Home Assistant Blueprint

A dedicated blueprint is included to link the W100 virtual thermostat to any climate entity.

Goal:

- Bidirectional synchronization between:
  - The W100 virtual thermostat entity (from this converter)
  - Any existing Home Assistant `climate` entity (heat pump, boiler thermostat, relay, etc.)

Behavior:

- Changes made on the W100 (mode, setpoint, fan) are propagated to the target climate entity.
- Changes made in Home Assistant (in the linked climate entity) are reflected back to the W100.
- Keeps UI/behavior consistent, so users can control their real HVAC system directly from the W100 with instant feedback.

Blueprint file:

- [`w100-blueprint.yaml`](w100-blueprint.yaml)

## Installation

### 1. Zigbee2MQTT external converter

1. Copy [`w100.js`](w100.js) into your Zigbee2MQTT external converters directory, e.g.:

   - `/config/zigbee2mqtt/w100.js`
   - or `/opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/w100.js`
   (path may vary depending on your setup)

2. In your Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml`, add:

   ```yaml
   external_converters:
     - w100.js
   ```

3. Restart Zigbee2MQTT.

4. Pair the Aqara W100:
   - Put Zigbee2MQTT in pairing mode.
   - Reset/pair the W100 as usual.
   - After join, the device should appear as `Aqara TH-S04D` / "Climate Sensor W100" with the new exposes.

---

### 2. Home Assistant blueprint

1. In Home Assistant, import the blueprint using `w100-blueprint.yaml`:

   - Go to "Settings" → "Automations & Scenes" → "Blueprints" → "Import Blueprint".
   - Upload the file or host it in a repo/raw URL and paste the link.

2. Create a new automation from this blueprint:
   - Select the W100 climate entity (exposed by Zigbee2MQTT with this converter).
   - Select the target `climate` entity you want to control (heat pump, thermostat, etc.).

3. Save and enable.

From now on, the W100 and the target climate entity remain synchronized in both directions.

## Why this project?

The stock behavior of the Aqara W100 with generic integrations is limited:

- Incomplete or unstable thermostat representation.
- Non-standard battery reporting.
- Lack of robust bidirectional sync with real HVAC devices.

This project focuses on:

- Correct protocol handling for the W100.
- Clean integration with Zigbee2MQTT.
- First-class Home Assistant UX through a proper climate entity and ready-to-use blueprint.
- Safety and predictability by:
  - Enforcing deterministic defaults.
  - Avoiding unwanted thermostat activation.
  - Respecting user-selected modes and last active configuration.

If you are using the Aqara W100 as a wall-mounted thermostat display/controller in a Home Assistant environment, this converter + blueprint combo is designed for you.

## Disclaimer

- This is a community-driven integration, not an official Aqara product.
- Use at your own risk.
- Review the code in [`w100.js`](w100.js) and the blueprint before deploying in critical environments.
